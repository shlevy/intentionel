;;; Commentary:

;; This package captures the automated aspects of my usage of org-mode
;; and org-brain to structure my intentional actions.  At best it is
;; most likely to remain a work-in-progress meeting only my needs at
;; the moment (and most likely it will simply be abandoned eventually
;; for some other approach), so if you're not me and you're using this
;; caveat progammator applies even more than usual.
