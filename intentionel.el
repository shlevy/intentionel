;; Package-Requires: (org stream)

;;; Commentary:

;; This package captures the automated aspects of my usage of org-mode
;; and org-brain to structure my intentional actions.  At best it is
;; most likely to remain a work-in-progress meeting only my needs at
;; the moment (and most likely it will simply be abandoned eventually
;; for some other approach), so if you're not me and you're using this
;; caveat progammator applies even more than usual.

;;; Code:

(require 'subr-x)
(require 'org)
(require 'stream)

(defun intentionel--active-task-p (pom)
  "Is the org entry at POM an \"active\" task?

An active task is one that will show up on the agenda, i.e. is in
TODO state, in IN PROGRESS state, is scheduled, or has a deadline."
  (org-with-point-at pom
    (when-let ((props (org-entry-properties))
	       (state (cdr (assoc "TODO" props))))
      (when (and (not (string= state "DONE"))
		 (or (string= state "TODO")
		     (string= state "IN PROGRESS")
		     (assoc "SCHEDULED" props)
		     (assoc "DEADLINE" props)))
	t))))

(defun intentionel--org-children (pom)
  "Get the immediate 'org-mode' children of the entry at POM.

Returns a stream of markers."
